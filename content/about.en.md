Hello I'm Gareth (but please call me gaz) a Platform engineer based in the north west of England, with nearly 7 years of experience under my belt I thought it was time to start taking my blog seriously and share some of the fun things I've been doing both in and outside of work.

#### A bit of background

I started my career at the beginning of 2017 as an apprentice working 1st line end user support I quickly moved on to hosting support after a sort stint at IBM from there I grew my career becoming knowledgeable in a number of technologies but settled in the best with Linux after 3 years dedicated to Linux I progressed into a DevOps role and I'm about to move onto a platform engineer role.

#### Why a blog Gaz?

Well over the years little blogs like this one have been a source of inspiration and great deal of knowledge and I think high time I gave back to the community, plus it's a fantastic to go back through my old projects update them and document them to show my journey from a plucky junior engineer to the engineer I am now.

#### Will I be sharing code?
100% code that I can share will be on my github (synced over from gitlab so I don't forget to update it) although as some of this blog will reference some stuff I've been working on professionally I won't be able to share some things.

#### You have something wrong in your translation.
I'm also using this blog to learn German by translating post and pages into german, please forgive any errors in the german versions of posts/pages and if you spot one help me learn by raising an issue for the blog's git repo.
